### Data pre-processing - Day 1 of 100 days challenge

Here are some of the datasets that fascinates me and I use some data pre-processing techniques to clean it.

### Dataset sources

The Datasets that you can try can be obtained from multiple sources below are some of them.

1. Kaggle datasets
2. reddit threads on datasets
3. UCI Machine learning dataset repository
4. Yelp Dataset
5. Google's Advanced Search featue - with keywords 
6. https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets - this repo contains almost all kinds of data in various field. Do check it out
7. You can use a API to get data from a website if a website doesn't have then we can go for library like BeautifulSoup to crawl a raw html web page

Note: The data pre-processing is crucial part for every data scientist because we got to choose what data we need for our specific use-case or problem.

Since we are trying to learn data preprocessing techinques, I'm taking a random ones and doing the pre-processing.


### Here is what we did in the data pre-processing techniques

1. Selecting the data
2. Processing the data
3. Transforming the data
4. Convert the data into vector for machine learning

This covers the probelm statement of classifying pokemons by their type 2 and type 1. some of the pre-processing techniques are explained only for understanding and not executed in the code.
