# Linear Regression 

In this module, the aspects of linear  regression are implemented.

#####  Simple Linear Regression 

The Problem Statement: The advertising dataset given in ISLR and to analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using a simple linear regression model.

#### Multilinear Regression

The Problem Statement: The advertising dataset given in ISLR and to analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising','Newspapaer advertising','Radio advertising' and 'sales' using a multilinear regression model.

#### Regularization methods for linear model

There are two regularization methods adopted to address the problems of linear regression 

1. Ridge regression
2. LASSO regression

#### Linear regression using Gradient descent 

The linear regression implemented using gradient descent using different dataset.

##### The module has proper documentation of the work as well the theory and math behind linear regression in simple terms.
